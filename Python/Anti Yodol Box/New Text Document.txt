Loraleth slowed her horse down at the sudden realization that everything got black before hearing a heavy crossbow fire. The next thing she knew her horse collapsed sending her through the air. She slammed into the ground before rolling over to see the dying horse and a metal ball rolling towards her face. Before she could react, fumes began to spray from the ball in all directions. Immediately,  Loraleth choked on the fumes as everything in her body began to seize as the noxious fumes sprayed from the metal ball. Emerging out of the magical darkness was a figure of powerful build with a mask that made her heart pound A feredir... Her mind reminded her of all the rumors. "don't fight It princess...let the poison settle. Fighting it will only cause you harm when you wake from it. " The figure lifted her body up and placed magical shackles on her wrist. No matter how hard she tried to move it felt like her entire body was locked in place and the shackles burned her wrists. The figure took out a rope and tied it to the shackles before it began winding around the Felidir's wrist. Loraleth could see something marking the ground roughly 10 feet from her before a  portal opened. The figure began dragging her across the ground, her face scrapeing the dirt until they entered the portal together and she lay face down on a cold cobblestone floor.
